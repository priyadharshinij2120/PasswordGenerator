Project Title
Simple Password Generator Using Python and Tkinter



Project Description

The **Simple Password Generator** is a desktop-based application developed using **Python** and **Tkinter**. It allows users to generate strong and secure passwords by selecting different character combinations such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface and ensures password security by using random character selection.



Objectives of the Project

* To generate strong and random passwords
* To provide customizable password options
* To help users improve password security
* To understand GUI development using Tkinter
* To apply Python libraries like `random` and `string`



Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **GUI Library:** Tkinter
* **Modules Used:**

  * `random` – for random password generation
  * `string` – for character sets
  * `tkinter.messagebox` – for alerts and messages



Features of the Project

* User-defined password length
* Option to include:

  * Uppercase letters
  * Lowercase letters
  * Numbers
  * Symbols
* Error handling for invalid inputs
* One-click password generation
* Copy generated password to clipboard
* Simple and clean user interface


 Working of the Application

1. The user enters the desired password length.
2. The user selects character options using checkboxes.
3. Clicking the **Generate Password** button creates a random password.
4. The generated password is displayed in the output box.
5. The **Copy Password** button copies the password to the clipboard.

Advantages

* Easy to use
* Generates strong and secure passwords
* Saves time
* Reduces risk of weak passwords
* Lightweight desktop application

---

 Limitations

* Does not save password history
* No password strength indicator
* Desktop-based only (not web-based)

Future Enhancements

* Add password strength meter
* Save generated passwords to a file
* Add dark mode UI
* Create a web-based version
* Add encryption for stored passwords

Conclusion

The **Simple Password Generator** project demonstrates the practical use of Python and Tkinter to build a functional GUI application. It helps users create secure passwords easily while improving understanding of event handling, GUI components, and Python modules. This project is suitable for beginners and internship-level submissions.
